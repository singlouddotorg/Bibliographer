// Minutes / Tunebooks — Shared Utilities
//
// Plain global-scope script (attaches to window.EZMinutesShared), NOT an ES module -
// deliberately, since `import`/`export` modules are blocked by Chrome when a page is
// opened directly via file://, and this whole suite's core value proposition is "double-
// click the file, no server needed." This follows exactly the same loading pattern
// tunebook-library.js already uses successfully. Load this file before any script that
// calls into it.
//
// Extracted from real, live duplication found across the suite: parseCSV existed as
// three near-identical copies (capture.html, compile.html, setup.html) with three small
// but real behavioral differences between them (BOM-stripping, CRLF handling, blank-row
// filtering) that had to be reconciled, not just picked arbitrarily - see the version
// history below. esc()/escapeHtml() existed in four places, sortPages()/comparePageMisc()
// in three (including the Tunebook Registry), findMasterListMatch() in two.

  // ---------------- Version ----------------
  // This is THIS FILE's version, not any application's.
  //
  // It briefly held the whole suite's version number, which was the right answer while one
  // repository held every app: the v156 review had found instructions.html six revisions
  // behind the running app, and a single literal that every page reads at runtime fixed it.
  // Splitting the suite made that answer wrong. Tunebooks carries its own copy of this file
  // and would have been shipping Minutes' version number inside it. Each app versions
  // itself now - see minutes-version.js and TUNEBOOK_EDITOR_VERSION - and what belongs here
  // is only the identity of these shared utilities, so an app can report which vintage of
  // them it is carrying.
  var SHARED_UTILS_VERSION = "1.1.0";

  // ---------------- CSV parsing ----------------
  // Reconciles the three prior copies' behavior: capture.html and setup.html stripped a
  // leading BOM and skipped bare \r; compile.html instead pre-normalized \r\n/\r to \n and
  // never explicitly stripped BOM (though its callers' own header.trim() calls happened
  // to strip it anyway, since \uFEFF falls in JS's whitespace class - confirmed by testing
  // a real BOM-prefixed import against compile.html before this consolidation, so this
  // isn't fixing a live bug, just making the behavior explicit and consistent rather than
  // accidental). capture.html and compile.html both filtered out fully-blank trailing
  // rows; setup.html didn't, but its own caller already defensively skips blank rows
  // itself, so adding the filter here is safe for all three original call sites.
